# Data set 2 Super Bowl Ads
https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/super_bowl_ads/
1. Where are they getting the amount of views and likes from?
2. What constitutes for an ad to contain humor, sexuality, or danger?
## Answer to Super bowl question 2
They probably create a file filled with words and topics that would be associated with humor for example and then when an ad is being tested they look for the main topics being shown in the ad and go through all the lists to see if those topics are in them.
Example a list of danger could include: Guns, Injuries, Crime, etc
If an ad shows someone using a gun to commit a crime then it would return true for contains danger
